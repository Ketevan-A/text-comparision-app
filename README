📝 Text Comparison and Difference Highlighting App

This repository hosts a robust and user-friendly web application designed for analyzing and visualizing the differences between two blocks of text. Built for developers, writers, and editors, the application efficiently compares submitted content and highlights inserted, deleted, and modified segments using a clear, color-coded interface.

✨ Key Features

Diffing Algorithm Integration: Utilizes an efficient text-diffing algorithm (e.g., Levenshtein or a custom implementation) to accurately calculate and identify discrepancies between the two inputs.

Intuitive Visualization: Differences are rendered using standard color-coding conventions (e.g., green for additions, red for deletions) for immediate visual clarity.

Real-Time Comparison: The comparison process executes instantly upon input changes, providing immediate feedback without the need for manual submission buttons or page reloads.

Clipboard Functionality: Includes convenient buttons or features to easily copy the original text, the modified text, or the resulting difference-highlighted output.

Responsive Layout: The application is designed to function flawlessly and maintain readability across all devices, ensuring the input fields and comparison results stack logically on mobile viewports.

🛠️ Technology Stack

HTML5 & CSS3: Provides the structural foundation and a clean, modern aesthetic for the user interface.

JavaScript (ES6+): Manages the core application logic, including the text input handling, the diffing calculation, and the dynamic rendering of the comparison results.

Frontend Framework (If Applicable): [Optional: Add framework like React, Vue, or Angular if used, e.g., "React: Utilized for component-based architecture and state management."]
